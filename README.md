# Introduction

This is a project I made to show how you could use SQL to extract and use COVID data for 2021 pertaining to Deaths and Vaccinations.

# Mini-Guide

1- Download the following data-sets:

2- Import the two datasets as tables into your local SQL Management Software and rename the first to 'CovidDeaths' and the second to 'CovidVaccinations'
